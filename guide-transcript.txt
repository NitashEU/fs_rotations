00:06 good afternoon friends I hope everyone's
00:08 doing well today I'm going to go over a
00:10 plus4 misrun that I did I want to go
00:13 over this because I did it as lightsmith
00:15 AC and a lot of people have been asking
00:18 for some gameplay showcasing uh to to
00:21 kind of discuss the rotations and
00:23 priorities and see how I play Mythic
00:25 plus as this Talent specs so obviously
00:28 this is a coordinated environment it's
00:30 going to be a little bit different from
00:31 pugs I will also do a pug video coming
00:33 soon but for now this is the only
00:36 available video I had of me playing
00:38 light Smith AC I'm just going to kind of
00:39 go over what my general rotation is like
00:42 if you are curious to see exactly what
00:44 spells I'm casting watch the top left of
00:45 the screen here so this first poll one
00:48 of the things you're going to see me do
00:49 a lot is press avenging Crusader
00:51 basically on CD one of the reasons I'm
00:53 able to be so aggressive with avenging
00:55 Crusader in this build is because it's
00:57 on a 1 minute cooldown so it's up very
00:59 frequently and you don't really need to
01:02 Divine toll during it so you can rotate
01:05 between Awakening procs avenging
01:07 Crusader cast and divine toll and so
01:11 between those you basically just always
01:14 have a cool down available to you with
01:16 bull work and weapon you want to just be
01:18 pressing them on CD use them as much as
01:20 possible the only rules with them are
01:23 make sure that you don't overwrite
01:24 existing weapons sometimes if it's just
01:27 tank damage going out you can overwrite
01:28 the existing weapon on the tank uh and
01:30 that's not a big deal but otherwise like
01:32 with DPS weapons sacred weapon make sure
01:35 that you never ever overwrite that on
01:37 somebody that already has one there's no
01:39 like priority system in terms of who
01:41 gets weapon it doesn't deal more damage
01:43 if it goes on somebody dealing more
01:45 damage uh it doesn't deal more damage on
01:47 higher APM specs it doesn't matter just
01:49 place it on a DPS player that doesn't
01:51 already have a
01:54 weapon so straight off obviously we're
01:56 dispelling the tank and then we're just
01:58 going to be popping avenging Crusader
01:60 all always inside of avenging Crusader
02:02 you want to make sure your main buttons
02:04 that you're pressing are judgment and
02:05 crusader strike those are what's going
02:07 to be doing all of your healing in this
02:09 build so the more judgments and crusader
02:11 strikes that you can get out the better
02:13 one important thing to keep in mind is
02:16 obviously there uh DEA got hit by that
02:19 ground effect but fortunately actually
02:22 it was the frontal but fortunately I had
02:24 lay on hands uh and Sack available for
02:26 him so he didn't die something to keep
02:29 in mind is uh you're going to See Me
02:30 weaving in holy power Spenders and
02:33 crusader strikes because of the hero
02:35 Talent Blessed Assurance which each time
02:38 you use a holy power spender it Buffs
02:40 our next Crusader strike by 120% so
02:42 that's what makes Crusader strike do so
02:44 much damage in healing basically outside
02:46 of this rotation you're going to see a
02:48 very very normal Holy Paladin gameplay
02:51 where I'm spot healing with word of
02:52 glory and uh holy shock and then during
02:56 AC you're just going to see me blasting
02:57 DPS so right here you'll see I have
02:60 haven't actually popped AC uh but I do
03:02 see that I have 12 stacks of Awakening
03:04 so I know that I will have an Awakening
03:06 proc so I end up just sending avenging
03:09 Crusader right there one thing to
03:11 remember is that the actual Awakening
03:14 proc deals a massive amount of healing
03:18 and the reason it does so much healing
03:20 is because it procs hammer and Anvil
03:22 because your judgment is guaranteed to
03:23 crit so if you have virtue out when you
03:26 proc Awakening with your judgment it's
03:28 going to full heal the group no matter
03:30 what their health is it's basically a
03:32 group wide lay on hands it's really
03:33 important that you utilize that and and
03:35 make powerful uses out of that so you'll
03:38 see right here I get virtue out the
03:40 whole group is getting uh damaged we're
03:42 all pretty low and right here I'm just
03:44 going to press judgment and boom entire
03:47 group full healed so uh keep in mind how
03:51 powerful that interaction is and and uh
03:53 don't waste your Awakening procs on
03:58 nothing so I use both my avenging
04:00 Crusader and my Awakening there and so
04:02 I'm not actually going to have anything
04:03 for when these bow Breakers hit 50%
04:06 you're going to see as soon as they
04:07 start thrashing we're going to make sure
04:10 right beforehand we top everyone up with
04:11 virtue and then I'm going to use Divine
04:14 toll so if you ever don't have AC this
04:17 is a build that uses Divine toll way
04:19 less often than the main build the main
04:21 build you send Divine toll as much as
04:22 possible this build it's all about
04:24 sending avenging Crusader as much as
04:26 possible and then holding Divine toll
04:28 for these damage events now that doesn't
04:31 mean you should be sitting on Divine
04:32 toll for like a full minute the most you
04:35 should ever sit on Divine toll for is
04:37 like 20 seconds because it's a 45 second
04:38 cool down you can use it very frequently
04:40 but it is important to remember that if
04:42 you were to choose one or the other it's
04:44 better to hold Divine toll for damage
04:46 events unless it's like a very dangerous
04:49 damage event right like if it's
04:50 something super super scary then
04:52 obviously you're going to want your
04:53 biggest super cool down which is
04:54 avenging Crusader but most damage events
04:56 can be handled with virtue Divine to
04:58 pretty easily so that allows you to be a
05:01 lot more aggressive with avenging
05:04 Crusader it's right here you're just
05:07 gonna see you know we we pop our
05:09 defensives and then I get uh virtue out
05:12 I spend my holy power on Word Of Glory I
05:14 use Divine to to pop us back up dispel
05:17 the tank and then we're just back to
05:19 normal standard holy P rotations which
05:21 is just prying holy shock and
05:25 Spenders the AC comes back up here I am
05:27 going to send it at the start of this
05:29 fight because I know that it's going to
05:30 come back up for the dangerous part of
05:32 the fight because this phase lasts a
05:34 while so we're just going to send it
05:36 immediately as soon as we pull boss the
05:37 reason you want to send more AC's even
05:39 if there's not damage going out is
05:41 because it Buffs all of our damage
05:42 abilities by a lot you're going to do a
05:44 lot more single Target damage uh again
05:46 you're going to want to weave in spender
05:48 CS spender CS so you're going to see me
05:50 doing that a lot got a little bit of an
05:53 awkward uh boss movement here but that's
05:56 okay and then I'm just going to skip
05:58 forward to where the damage defense
05:59 actually start kicking in on this boss
06:01 so here I'm going to obviously you want
06:04 to let a few ticks go out before you
06:06 press virtue and then I'm going to press
06:08 virtue here I'm going to use Divine toll
06:10 like I
06:13 said always great to just rely on virtue
06:15 Divine toll to carry a lot of the like
06:17 damage points in this build if you don't
06:19 have AC obviously if you have AC then
06:22 you should use that so right here I have
06:24 a decision to make I know that I ideally
06:27 would like to have avenging Crusader for
06:29 the burn because it will just help me do
06:31 way more damage but that being said it's
06:35 better to just keep your group alive
06:36 like healer damage matters a decent
06:38 amount but nothing is more important
06:40 than making sure your group lives
06:41 through intermission so you right here
06:44 you're going to see me I have to make
06:45 the decision okay I don't really have
06:47 holy power we're starting to take a lot
06:49 of damage we need to live through
06:50 intermission I do see that I have 10
06:53 stacks of Awakening so I'm actually just
06:55 going to pop AC here and then I will try
06:58 to hold my Awakening for the
07:00 intermission phase so we'll see we'll
07:02 see how that works
07:03 out I'm going to pop AC immediately just
07:06 full heal the group with judgment and
07:08 then we're just you know spending holy
07:10 power into Crusader strike holy power
07:12 into Crusader strike and then pressing
07:17 judgment this is my Awakening proc so
07:20 this is going to do a huge amount of
07:21 healing so I do opt to just press it
07:23 there because I need the healing right
07:25 look at how low we all are it I'd
07:27 rather just full heal the group get us
07:29 topped and nice and safe so uh I do go
07:33 into this with basically no healing or
07:35 no damage at all that kind of sucks but
07:37 also we're totally fine and healthy so
07:40 that is what really matters the most
07:42 people are overvaluing healer damage a
07:45 little bit too much right now that's not
07:46 to say healer damage doesn't matter but
07:48 when you have specs doing this type of
07:51 DPS you know it's just like getting a
07:55 couple extra 100,000 at the cost of
07:56 group safety is just not really worth it
07:60 so again I'm GNA kind of skip forward to
08:01 the damage event part portion of this
08:03 you'll be able to see you know I'll just
08:05 slow this down so you guys can kind of
08:07 see my rotation but I pop AC here and
08:10 then we're just going to look at this
08:11 slightly slower so he's casting Eternal
08:14 Darkness I probably should have waited
08:15 to pop AC until Eternal Darkness
08:18 actually began but that's okay boss is
08:20 already so low that I know it's not
08:22 really a big deal and I have Divine tool
08:24 still available here you know you'll see
08:26 me just judgement Crusader strike
08:27 Crusader strike judgement getting them
08:29 all on cool down before I have to dodge
08:31 here because I know that I'm not going
08:32 to be able to stay in melee then I'm
08:35 going to throw out some you know one of
08:36 my empowered holy shocks get uh get a
08:40 word of Glory out so now my next Blessed
08:42 Assurance is going to do a lot so now
08:44 boss is coming back in but obviously
08:47 then then inor just phases so that
08:50 wasn't the best example of an avenging
08:52 Crusader rotation but that did give you
08:54 an idea of how I play it when I have to
08:55 leave melee I see a lot of H Pals leave
08:58 melee and then they end up just just
08:60 like not pressing buttons right they
09:02 they'll walk out of melee and then
09:03 they'll just not use anything because
09:06 they'll be like I'm a melee healer I
09:07 don't know what to do they'll Panic for
09:09 a second we have most of our buttons are
09:11 actually ranged right we have all of our
09:13 holy power Spenders are ranged holy
09:14 shock is ranged uh hammer of Wrath
09:17 judgment and then we have you know
09:19 Divine toll and divine toll will allow
09:21 you to cast from range for like six
09:23 globals right because you press Divine
09:24 toll then you can spend your holy power
09:27 you follow that up with triple holy
09:28 shocks with more holy power spender
09:30 triple holy shocks more Holy Fire
09:31 spender Etc and you you're able to just
09:34 play from range for like a lot of time
09:37 so it's important to remember that even
09:39 when leaving melee with this build we
09:41 have a lot in our toolkit to keep the
09:43 group up and you want to make sure that
09:44 you're not just having dead time with
09:45 the spec you want to make sure that
09:47 you're consistently outputting healing
09:51 uh the rest of this is just a burn phase
09:52 nothing to really talk about here we
09:54 pull through the wall here so whenever
09:56 if somebody's pulling through the wall
09:57 you got to be really careful and watch
09:58 their health because they they take a
10:00 ton of damage uh DEA was actually
10:02 the one that pulled but Jamie ripped
10:04 aggro uh so he's the one who ended up
10:06 taking the tank slash I did sack the
10:09 evoker because the evoker is the one
10:11 that pulled and I expected him to get
10:12 the tank slash uh but Jamie ended up
10:15 ripping aggro so because of that uh I
10:17 think it was like healer aggro or
10:18 something you can also if people are
10:21 pulling through the walls in your myths
10:23 which some people do in lower Keys I
10:25 know it's not quite as common as in
10:26 higher keys but if that is happening
10:29 just be aware that you can repealer
10:30 aggro and those Guardians will anim a
10:33 slash from very far so whenever that
10:35 happens just make sure you sack whoever
10:37 pulls and then you defensive
10:40 yourself so here I'm basically just
10:43 going to pop AC make sure I get virtue
10:45 out before hands and then just blast
10:47 damage and the more judgments and holy
10:50 power Spenders and crusader strikes that
10:52 you can get out during AC the better
10:54 you'll see most of my holy Powers just
10:56 spent on Shield of the righteous that's
10:58 because I'm doing so much healing with
10:59 AC that I don't really need to spend on
11:02 Word Of Glory and shield of the
11:04 righteous also procs Blessed Assurance
11:06 it's any holy power spender at all so
11:08 you'll notice you'll notice I do that a
11:11 lot then just good use of virtue making
11:14 sure you're pressing it a lot and uh and
11:17 using your empowered holy shocks you're
11:18 going to go a long time sometimes
11:20 without pressing holy shock it's going
11:22 to feel very unnatural in this build but
11:24 just remember like this build does not
11:26 play like regular H palal at all it's a
11:28 completely different play style you
11:31 deprioritize holy shock in Wings you
11:33 deprioritize Hammer of Wrath in Wings
11:35 you uh deprioritize holy prism all that
11:38 matters in Wings is just getting as many
11:40 judgments and crusader strikes out as
11:42 possible and then making sure you just
11:44 have good virtue timing those are like
11:46 the two big things if you can get good
11:49 virtue timings and make sure that inside
11:51 your AC window you're playing really
11:53 well and efficiently you're going to do
11:56 so much healing and damage so this
11:58 Pack's a little boring I don't know we
12:00 don't pull anything into this I'm just
12:02 going to kind of skip ahead okay this is
12:03 a fun one so we end up doing a double
12:05 here so we're going to take a look at
12:07 this um you got to make sure you're
12:08 getting your dispels out at the right
12:10 time I pop AC early on I see that I've
12:13 got an Awakening proc coming up and
12:15 during The Gather is some of the most
12:16 dangerous times for the tank so I end up
12:19 holding my virtue because no one else is
12:21 really injured doesn't really feel
12:23 necessary uh I am going to start getting
12:25 virtue out soon however so here's an
12:29 interesting thing that I do now I don't
12:30 always recommend this but this is kind
12:32 of a clutch play that you can do if your
12:34 tank is ever taking a ton of damage
12:37 and you know that they're going to get
12:38 beat up you can place your weapon on
12:40 them your sacred weapon now this can be
12:43 dangerous again because you share Health
12:46 with your sacred uh weapon Target that's
12:49 the new Talent that's the spirit link
12:50 style new Talent this is one of the most
12:52 dangerous packs in the entire dungeon
12:54 for the tank so what I do is I place my
12:58 uh sacred weapon on Squish and what
13:01 that's going to do is make it so that I
13:02 share you see how much damage I just
13:04 dealt to myself immediately but that's
13:06 going to make it so that he's basically
13:08 unkillable and we're just going to share
13:09 Health pools the entire time so I pop my
13:12 defensive to make sure that I don't take
13:14 too much damage right I end up getting a
13:17 bleed so I bubble off the bleed so that
13:19 I can share Health with him while I'm
13:21 bubbled so this is basically just like
13:23 I'm making him Immortal you see how much
13:25 HPS I'm doing 2.6 million HPS that is
13:28 literally
13:30 mostly all that new Talent very very
13:33 little of that is me actively healing
13:34 him it's mostly just the health
13:37 redistribution putting in massive
13:38 amounts of work so that interaction can
13:42 be game breakingly good if you use it
13:45 well it can also be kind of troll uh it
13:48 can get people killed so you have to
13:50 keep that in mind like if your health
13:51 ever gets transferred right before an
13:53 AOE that can be super dangerous but that
13:56 is a that basically made it so that
13:59 swiish was Immortal this entire pole and
14:01 with this being one of the most
14:02 dangerous poles in any of these dungeons
14:04 for tank survivability that was a a huge
14:07 thing to be able to do and it's a very
14:09 very valuable part of our kit that when
14:11 used well can turn the tides so keep
14:14 that in
14:17 mind here I uh I'm still just super
14:20 scared for squish's health because these
14:22 Guardians absolutely destroy tanks with
14:24 their animal slashes so I'm just preing
14:27 in order to funnel my healing and to
14:29 just make sure
14:30 that squish has um as much Dr as
14:33 possible to handle these
14:35 things so here I'm going to sack him
14:38 because I don't want him to take those
14:39 those anima slashes just raw and then I
14:42 get another uh avenging wrath proc or
14:45 sorry avenging Crusader proc and we are
14:48 just hard chilling in terms of healing
14:50 so doing this with boss is very very
14:52 scary right doing this with boss is is
14:55 super dangerous for your tank because
14:57 again it's that double Guardian so I had
14:60 the option to place my weapon on squish
15:03 there again and do the same thing I did
15:05 the previous poll but the difference was
15:07 this pole I did not have any type of
15:10 major personal survivability like I
15:12 didn't have Bubble which is like the the
15:15 main thing that I would use to live this
15:16 kind of stuff so because I didn't have
15:19 Bubble I wasn't really comfortable
15:21 sharing because there was also this
15:22 Stinger that was going out uh and
15:25 basically deals a bunch of damage up
15:27 front so if I was splitting my help was
15:29 Health with squish here I could have
15:31 just died or I could have gotten him
15:33 killed if I had taken too much damage
15:35 right cuz I got like multiple bleeds
15:37 plus the frontal it's just too scary to
15:39 share my health unless I have Bubble so
15:42 I opted to not share my health with
15:43 squish there and instead what you're
15:45 going to see from me here is just basic
15:48 avenging Crusader gameplay it's just
15:50 super super prioritizing Crusader strike
15:53 fenders Crusader strike judgment that's
15:56 all I'm pressing within the These Wings
15:58 windows and then obviously keeping
15:60 consecrate down for damage but that's
16:02 pretty much
16:05 it the other nice interaction with
16:07 Shield of the righteous and crusader
16:09 strike when you're in AC is that it
16:12 resets your Crusader strike cool down it
16:15 reduces Crusader strike cool down by 1.5
16:17 seconds so not only is Shield of the
16:20 righteous spending during AC beneficial
16:22 for damage and you typically don't need
16:24 the healing for Mor of Glory but it also
16:26 gives you more Crusader strikes so it's
16:28 actually increasing your healing in this
16:31 particular circumstance as well overall
16:33 it is more healing to use your holy
16:35 power on Word Of Glory but if nobody
16:38 imminently needs the spot healing power
16:40 I think it's better to just spend on
16:41 Shield of the righteous to get more
16:43 Crusader strikes out and more Blessed
16:45 Assurance procs for your Crusader
16:48 strikes uh the rest of this fight is
16:50 kind of boring so I'm just going to skip
16:51 forward it's just dodge and and locate
16:54 so this is a great avenging Crusader
16:56 pull right it's it's a bit chaotic it's
16:58 hard to say in melee but there is a
17:00 bunch of just random damage going out on
17:02 people on top of a big AOE so you're
17:05 going to see me immediately pop avening
17:07 Crusader at the start of this poll so
17:09 that I can make sure everybody is fully
17:11 topped when this stagghorn does its AOE
17:14 so uh you're going to see very soon the
17:16 sagor is going to start doing the AOE
17:18 you're going to watch me put virtue out
17:20 there's virtue to get the Dr and then
17:22 immediately top people with avenging
17:24 Crusader
17:25 rotation um once again just making sure
17:30 that you have good virtue timings and
17:32 are aggressive with using AC is going to
17:34 be the huge difference maker for these
17:36 Dungeons and you'll see I often just sit
17:39 on Divine toll like in the other build
17:41 you want to use Divine toll all the time
17:43 but with this build I'm using Divine
17:45 tool far less frequently because you
17:47 want to make sure that you have avenging
17:50 Crusader usage very very high which
17:52 often means that you end up needing to
17:54 save Divine toll for some of these
17:56 damage events or else people end up just
17:58 getting in too much Dam
17:60 so there you'll see this is an example
18:02 of a damage event happening when I don't
18:04 have AC and that's when I use Divine
18:06 tool now I've got all these procs
18:08 because as soon as you hit Divine toll
18:10 you just get so much power you've got
18:12 your triple holy shocks you've got your
18:14 uh your strong word of glories uh full
18:18 holy power you just have so much healing
18:20 power after Divine toll and during
18:22 Divine toll that you don't really need
18:25 to rely on anything else here AC comes
18:28 back up so boom we're just going to go
18:29 straight back into AC the more AC the
18:32 better you'll see just how much healing
18:33 it's doing on its own without me having
18:35 to really press anything any like
18:37 targeted healing like you'll see my
18:39 mouse barely even hovers over people's
18:41 frames like I spend so much of this key
18:45 not worried about Target healing at all
18:48 and instead just like generic AOE
18:50 healing because AC just hard carries so
18:52 much right now with Blessed Assurance
18:54 we're going to skip forward here I pop
18:57 AC somebody died because they stood in a
18:59 in one of these swirlies so that was a
19:01 bit unfortunate but we be res we go
19:03 straight to boss one thing I will talk
19:05 about is the transition here so this is
19:08 this is a boss that's very scary for H
19:10 palal if you don't know how to position
19:11 right one of the things I talk to people
19:14 a lot about is virtue most people assume
19:17 I want to place virtue on the person
19:18 most in danger right but that's not
19:21 actually the best way to play virtue
19:22 because virtue is only a 30 yard range
19:24 you want to make sure that virtue gets
19:26 cast on the player most centered around
19:29 your your group it should be positional
19:30 who you put virtue on so what I like to
19:32 do with this phase is make sure I get to
19:34 the center of the room because people
19:35 are always spread out on this fight but
19:37 if you walk to the center of the room
19:39 right before he transitions he
19:40 transitions at 40 and
19:42 70% so you'll see me positioned here and
19:46 then I know that I am always positioned
19:48 correctly for uh for the best versu so
19:52 if I were to cast it for example on the
19:56 dragon over here it would miss it might
19:58 miss me h no it would probably hit me
20:00 but it would absolutely miss the shaman
20:02 that's behind me but if I cast it on
20:04 myself it's going to go on everyone so
20:06 positional uh choices when it comes to
20:09 who you virtue is super important you'll
20:12 see there I was able to hit him and him
20:14 even though they're like 6 60 yards
20:15 apart I position myself well and then I
20:18 cast virtue on myself and once you get
20:20 everybody with virtue in this phase it's
20:22 very easy to heal this phase is only
20:25 chaotic when you can't get virtue out on
20:27 everyone or when everyone is spread out
20:29 and and you're not like centered so
20:31 Center yourself well before this comes
20:33 out and then make sure that you're
20:35 getting your virtue cast out the second
20:38 the first damage event hits so as soon
20:40 as that first tick hits immediately
20:41 virtue you want to spend some holy power
20:44 and then you'll see I always save Divine
20:46 toll for this so straight into Divine
20:48 toll then I've got a bunch of empowered
20:50 holy shocks and a bunch of holy power to
20:53 spend super super easy to heal it that
20:55 way uh and and then you can just send
20:57 avenging crusader on cool down for
20:59 damage and you really don't need it for
21:01 those phases here again you're just
21:03 going to see me popping AC aggressively
21:06 and you'll notice once again Divine toll
21:08 is sitting available but I'm not going
21:10 to spend it because I know that this
21:12 phase is coming back up again and I want
21:14 it to be up uh because of these reavers
21:17 actually I end up pressing Divine to
21:19 early now normally we would not be
21:21 pulling reavers into boss but as you'll
21:24 see we were we were trying to go for the
21:25 two chest uh so because we were going
21:28 for the two chest we ended up pulling
21:29 these ravers in and and that ended up
21:31 making this pull a little bit sketchier
21:33 than usual not to mention pretty poor
21:35 positioning from us which uh made it so
21:37 that virtue could not hit a lot of
21:39 players so now what do we do right
21:43 because of that uh we have two options
21:45 available fortunately AC is coming back
21:48 and now AC is available so best option
21:50 just slam AC however even if I didn't
21:53 have AC available here I still have Aura
21:55 Mastery I still have virtue I still have
21:57 bubble and I still have sack
21:59 and lay on hands so even if I had
22:01 literally zero throughput cool Downs
22:03 available I could still fully immune
22:05 give somebody a 40% Dr give everybody an
22:09 extra 15% Dr and pop lay on hands on the
22:12 player that dropped the most so we could
22:15 easily survive this phase without
22:17 anything but what you'll see is uh I
22:19 actually do get avening Crusader back so
22:21 easy peasy make sure once again that I
22:23 am positioned as close to the middle as
22:26 possible there's always going to be some
22:28 way to get towards the the center of the
22:29 room obviously the room gets more and
22:32 more filled up so it can get a little
22:33 bit sketchy but in general it should be
22:35 pretty straightforward figuring out a
22:37 way to get somewhat reasonably centered
22:39 so that you can get virtue on your whole
22:41 team uh I get virtue out and immediately
22:43 just start popping uh avenging Crusader
22:46 now because this requires being in melee
22:48 I end up pressing bubble I believe and
22:50 yeah so I'm just going to press bubble
22:52 and I'm just going to sit in the middle
22:53 here let all this fall on me while
22:55 I just slam my DPS buttons and heal the
22:57 group bubble is insanely strong for that
23:00 intermission right there and I highly
23:02 suggest saving it for the second
23:03 intermission cuz that's the one where
23:05 you're going to have the most amount of
23:06 stuff on the ground to
23:08 dodge so yeah that's that's the fight
23:11 that's AC uh obviously it kind of goes a
23:16 lot against what we've learned with the
23:19 herald build so the heral build it's all
23:21 about targeted healing it's all about
23:23 spending holy power and prioritizing
23:25 holy shock but then with avenging
23:27 Crusader it's pretty much opposite you
23:30 only want to
23:31 prioritize uh holy power in order to get
23:33 Blessed assurance that you can get
23:35 bigger Crusader strikes and your biggest
23:38 prios within Wings is just judgment and
23:41 crusader strike and just slamming damage
23:43 as much as you can now holy shocks take
23:46 a huge backseat in this build when
23:48 you're in wings and the biggest problem
23:50 I see from players when they're trying
23:53 to make their avenging Crusader window
23:55 strong is just throwing out holy shocks
23:57 during it that's pretty much the worst
23:59 button that you can press holy shock
24:02 Hammer of Wrath and holy prism are all
24:05 basically useless during avenging
24:07 Crusader so you want to be very careful
24:09 not to be like slamming those during
24:12 your AC window another thing that's
24:14 important to keep in mind get your
24:16 virtues out before AC try not to be
24:19 pressing virtue during AC you want to
24:21 make sure that your AC window itself is
24:24 as capitalized as possible by getting
24:26 all the other globals out first so
24:28 things like consecrate maintenance uh
24:31 virtue all that kind of stuff that you
24:33 want up before the damage event make
24:35 sure those are down prior to you
24:37 pressing AC so that you don't have to
24:39 press them during AC and then lastly
24:42 paying attention to your Awakening sacks
24:44 and your Awakening procs this build
24:45 relies on awakening way more than the
24:47 other build mostly because the Awakening
24:50 proc is shorter however it's much
24:53 stronger in terms of the initial hit so
24:56 your initial judgment that's going to
24:57 proc Awakening will heal your group like
24:59 a lay on hands on everyone and I know I
25:01 mentioned this before but I can't
25:03 overstate how important it is to be
25:04 paying attention to that and making sure
25:06 that you're not wasting that that's all
25:08 for now guys if you have any questions
25:10 please let me know in the comments below
25:11 I hope this was helpful I will make sure
25:13 to do a pug video soon so you guys get a
25:15 more chaotic version of this and and try
25:17 to see what it's like when when it's in
25:19 a less coordinated environment but it's
25:21 generally speaking all the same stuff
25:23 when I pug with AC I'm still super
25:25 aggressive with using it uh it's just a
25:27 matter of making sure that your virtue
25:29 timings are good and you're holding
25:32 Divine toll for these damage patterns
25:34 where you need them if you're not going
25:35 to have AC for it all right thanks for
25:37 watching guys and I will catch you guys
25:39 on the next video
