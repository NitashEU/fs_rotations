**Task Title:** Existing Project Documentation
**Task Type:** Documentation
**Affected Components/Files:** Project Repositories (Documentation Files)
**Priority:** Medium
**Detailed Description:** Document all existing projects to create a comprehensive knowledge base for future development. This involves creating documentation that outlines each project's purpose, architecture, key features, setup instructions, dependencies, and any other relevant information necessary for understanding and further developing the project. The goal is to build a "memory bank" of project knowledge to facilitate future development efforts, maintenance, and onboarding of new team members.
**Context/Background:** Currently, there is limited or no comprehensive documentation available for our existing projects. This lack of documentation poses a challenge for future development, making it difficult to understand project details, onboard new developers, and plan for future features or bug fixes efficiently. This documentation task is crucial to address this gap and ensure smooth and informed future development processes.
