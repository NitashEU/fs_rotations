# Project Scope

This project is a plugin for a script used in World of Warcraft, functioning as an internal cheat. The script's functions are documented in the `_api` folder and cannot be modified. The plugin will be loaded by the script. The goal is to create rotations for specs, which will play in-game as perfectly as possible.
