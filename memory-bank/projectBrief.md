# Project Brief: Holy Paladin Rotation Plugin

## Overview
This project is a World of Warcraft rotation plugin for Holy Paladin specialization, built to interface with the Sylvanas script system. The plugin provides automated healing and damage rotation logic while maintaining high performance and reliability.

## Core Requirements
1. Implement optimal Holy Paladin healing rotations
2. Provide damage dealing capabilities when healing isn't needed
3. Support various talent builds including Avenging Crusader
4. Maintain modular and extensible architecture
5. Ensure efficient performance with minimal overhead
6. Robust plugin initialization and validation
7. Natural-feeling rotation execution through humanization
8. Effective latency compensation and timing control

## Project Scope
1. Core Systems
   - Entry system with efficient module loading
   - Custom healing engine with smart target selection
   - Custom combat forecast implementation
   - Custom health prediction system
   - Humanized action timing system
   - Comprehensive buff/aura tracking

2. Rotation Systems
   - Spell priority and rotation logic
   - Talent-based rotation adjustments
   - Resource management
   - Cooldown optimization
   - State-based decision making

3. User Interface
   - Customizable settings and menu interface
   - Type-safe configuration options
   - Performance tuning controls
   - Humanizer customization
   - Visual feedback systems

4. Quality Assurance
   - Performance monitoring and optimization
   - Documentation and maintainability
   - Error handling and validation
   - Module loading verification
   - State validation

## Technical Boundaries
1. API Integration
   - `_api/` directory contains Sylvanas script interfaces - cannot be modified
   - Must follow Sylvanas API conventions and patterns
   - Selective use of provided modules based on needs
   - Custom implementations where necessary

2. Performance Requirements
   - Plugin must handle WoW game state and event management
   - Performance critical - must maintain high update frequency
   - Entry system must validate environment before loading
   - Module loading must be optimized for performance
   - Memory usage must be carefully managed

3. Implementation Constraints
   - Maintain compatibility with Sylvanas API
   - Follow established module patterns
   - Ensure type safety through annotations
   - Implement proper error boundaries
   - Support progressive loading

## Success Criteria
1. Healing Effectiveness
   - Accurate healing target selection
   - Optimal spell usage and priority
   - Efficient resource management
   - Smart cooldown usage

2. Performance
   - Minimal performance impact
   - Efficient memory usage
   - Fast initialization
   - Responsive updates

3. User Experience
   - Smooth rotation transitions
   - Natural action timing
   - Clear configuration options
   - Intuitive settings

4. Technical Quality
   - Reliable error handling
   - Robust spec validation
   - Clean module boundaries
   - Comprehensive documentation
