## 2. System Pattern Definition (PO)
**Status:** Completed
**Assigned Role:** Project Owner
- Define the structure and organization of the memory bank for fs_rotations.
- Select appropriate tools and technologies for extracting and storing information.
- Define the process for reviewing and updating the memory bank content.

## 3. Software Engineering & Design (SWE)
**Status:** Completed
**Assigned Role:** Software Engineer
- Design the information architecture for the fs_rotations memory bank.
- Create templates and examples for different types of information to be stored.
- Define the metadata and tagging scheme for the memory bank to facilitate search and navigation.

## 4. Development (DEV)
**Status:** Completed
**Assigned Role:** Developer
- Extract information from the fs_rotations project and store it in the memory bank, including:
    - Code structure and organization.
    - Key algorithms and data structures.
    - Configuration settings and parameters.
    - API interfaces and dependencies.
- Follow the established guidelines for storing information in the memory bank.
- Use the selected tools and technologies.

## 5. Review (Reviewer)
**Status:** Completed
**Assigned Role:** Reviewer
- Review the content of the memory bank for accuracy, completeness, and clarity.
- Provide feedback to the developers on areas for improvement.
- Ensure that the memory bank accurately reflects the existing project.
