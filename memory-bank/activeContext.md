# Active Context: Holy Paladin Rotation Plugin

## Current Focus
1. Heal engine implementation is primary focus
   - Target selection logic optimization complete
   - Clustered healing calculations refined
   - Enemy target selection implemented
   - Performance optimization ongoing
   - Health prediction system integration
2. Core systems implementation stable
3. Rotation logic implementation progressing
   - Holy Prism implementation complete
     * Cast on enemy target, radiates healing to allies
     * Uses generic enemy clustered heal target selection
     * Integrated with heal engine
     * 30-yard radius, 5 target maximum
     * Positioned after Beacon of Virtue in rotation
