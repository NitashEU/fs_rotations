Spell Priority for Holy Paladin
-------------------------------

Regardless of build choice, your primary focus will be casting as many ![Image 118: Holy Shock Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_holy_searinglight.jpg) Holy Shocks as possible, as well as spending as much Holy Power as possible through one of: ![Image 119: Light of Dawn Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_paladin_lightofdawn.jpg) Light of Dawn, ![Image 120: Word of Glory Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/inv_helmet_96.jpg) Word of Glory (or ![Image 121: Eternal Flame Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/inv_torch_thrown.jpg) Eternal Flame), or ![Image 122: Shield of the Righteous Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/ability_paladin_shieldofvengeance.jpg) Shield of the Righteous. When you can do none of the above, you will begin casting abilities that are less important or serve as maintenance buffs that you need to keep on cooldown as much as possible (think ![Image 123: Holy Prism Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_paladin_holyprism.jpg) Holy Prism).

When no healing is needed, the priority will change slightly, and your goals will be to keep ![Image 124: Consecration Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_holy_innerfire.jpg) Consecration down as much as possible and spending Holy Power on ![Image 125: Shield of the Righteous Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/ability_paladin_shieldofvengeance.jpg) Shield of the Righteous. If you end up talenting into ![Image 126: Righteous Judgment Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/ability_priest_holybolts01.jpg) Righteous Judgment, then you will want to also keep ![Image 127: Judgment Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_holy_righteousfury.jpg) Judgment on cooldown to have a chance at spawning extra consecrates.

When you select a desired build, you will be given much more detailed priority lists that explain how and when to use each ability.

Holy Paladin — Raid Casting Build
---------------------------------

When playing this build, keep in mind that despite being a "Casting" build, you will still want to stay towards melee. This will allow you to not only auto-attack the boss, but also gain value from abilities such as ![Image 128: Crusader Strike Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_holy_crusaderstrike.jpg) Crusader Strike, ![Image 129: Consecration Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_holy_innerfire.jpg) Consecration, and even the rare ![Image 130: Shield of the Righteous Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/ability_paladin_shieldofvengeance.jpg) Shield of the Righteous.

Where this build differs from the "melee" build is that it focuses on consuming ![Image 131: Infusion of Light Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/ability_paladin_infusionoflight.jpg) Infusion of Light as much as possible to gain extra healing through not only the proc consumption, but the extra ![Image 132: Holy Shock Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_holy_searinglight.jpg) Holy Shock and Holy Power spender casts

1.  Keep ![Image 133: Beacon of Light Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/ability_paladin_beaconoflight.jpg) Beacon of Light and ![Image 134: Beacon of Faith Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/ability_paladin_beaconsoflight.jpg) Beacon of Faith on two ranged targets who have weak survivability (Hunters, Shadow Priests, Boomkins, etc).
2.  Cast ![Image 135: Beacon of Virtue Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/ability_paladin_beaconofinsight.jpg) Beacon of Virtue as much as possible during a fight. Try to line it up with heavy damage windows without keeping it on cooldown for too long. If you are having mana issues, you can cast it less frequently.
3.  Use ![Image 136: Blessing of Summer Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/ability_ardenweald_paladin_summer.jpg) Blessing of Summer as much as possible during a fight. Every buff can be safely placed upon yourself with only ![Image 137: Blessing of Summer Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/ability_ardenweald_paladin_summer.jpg) Blessing of Summer requiring any additional thought (when possible, aim to have it up during cooldowns.)
4.  Keep ![Image 138: Holy Prism Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_paladin_holyprism.jpg) Holy Prism on cooldown as much as possible to proc ![Image 139: Dawnlight Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/inv_ability_heraldofthesunpaladin_dawnlight.jpg) Dawnlight. When possible, you will want to use Holy Prism during ![Image 140: Awakening Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/inv_helm_plate_raidpaladin_n_01.jpg) Awakening to generate extra ![Image 141: Sun's Avatar Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/ability_paladin_holyavenger.jpg) Sun's Avatar procs.
5.  Keep ![Image 142: Barrier of Faith Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/ability_paladin_barrieroffaith.jpg) Barrier of Faith on cooldown as much as possible to proc ![Image 143: Dawnlight Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/inv_ability_heraldofthesunpaladin_dawnlight.jpg) Dawnlight. When possible, you will want to use Holy Prism during ![Image 144: Awakening Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/inv_helm_plate_raidpaladin_n_01.jpg) Awakening to generate extra ![Image 145: Sun's Avatar Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/ability_paladin_holyavenger.jpg) Sun's Avatar procs. You will generally want to use this on the tank who has aggro of the boss, or someone taking very high damage per second (think debuffs).
6.  Cast ![Image 146: Eternal Flame Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/inv_torch_thrown.jpg) Eternal Flame when you have the ![Image 147: Empyrean Legacy Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/item_holyspark.jpg) Empyrean Legacy proc off cooldown.
7.  Spend Holy Power on ![Image 148: Light of Dawn Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_paladin_lightofdawn.jpg) Light of Dawn or ![Image 149: Eternal Flame Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/inv_torch_thrown.jpg) Eternal Flame.
8.  Cast ![Image 150: Holy Shock Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_holy_searinglight.jpg) Holy Shock as much as possible.
9.  Aim to cast ![Image 151: Holy Light Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_holy_surgeoflight.jpg) Holy Light when you have both a ![Image 152: Divine Favor Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_holy_heal.jpg) Divine Favor proc available**AND** a ![Image 153: Infusion of Light Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/ability_paladin_infusionoflight.jpg) Infusion of Light proc.
10.  Spend remaining Holy Power if possible.
11.  Cast ![Image 154: Crusader Strike Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_holy_crusaderstrike.jpg) Crusader Strike to reduce ![Image 155: Holy Shock Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_holy_searinglight.jpg) Holy Shock cooldown.
12.  Cast ![Image 156: Hammer of Wrath Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_paladin_hammerofwrath.jpg) Hammer of Wrath.
13.  Cast ![Image 157: Judgment Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_holy_righteousfury.jpg) Judgment to have a chance to spawn extra ![Image 158: Consecration Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_holy_innerfire.jpg) Consecrations.
14.  Consume ![Image 159: Infusion of Light Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/ability_paladin_infusionoflight.jpg) Infusion of Light when you cannot ![Image 160: Holy Shock Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_holy_searinglight.jpg) Holy Shock and do not have enough Holy Power to use ![Image 161: Light of Dawn Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_paladin_lightofdawn.jpg) Light of Dawn or ![Image 162: Word of Glory Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/inv_helmet_96.jpg) Word of Glory.
15.  Keep ![Image 163: Tyr's Deliverance Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/inv_mace_2h_artifactsilverhand_d_01.jpg) Tyr's Deliverance on cooldown as much as possible.
16.  Cast ![Image 164: Judgment Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_holy_righteousfury.jpg) Judgment when you cannot do any of the above.
17.  Cast ![Image 165: Hammer of Wrath Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_paladin_hammerofwrath.jpg) Hammer of Wrath when you cannot do any of the above.
18.  Cast ![Image 166: Consecration Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_holy_innerfire.jpg) Consecration when you cannot do any of the above.
19.  Use ![Image 167: Crusader Strike Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_holy_crusaderstrike.jpg) Crusader Strike when you cannot do any of the above or want to simply deal extra damage because no healing is needed.

Holy Paladin — Raid Melee Build
-------------------------------

Where this build differs from typical "Casting" builds is that you will be primarily using ![Image 168: Crusader Strike Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_holy_crusaderstrike.jpg) Crusader Strike as your filler global. By talenting into ![Image 169: Crusader's Might Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/ability_paladin_swiftretribution.jpg) Crusader's Might, you allow yourself to gain extra ![Image 170: Holy Shock Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_holy_searinglight.jpg) Holy Shocks while still generating Holy Power and outputting extra damage.

1.  Keep ![Image 171: Beacon of Light Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/ability_paladin_beaconoflight.jpg) Beacon of Light and ![Image 172: Beacon of Faith Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/ability_paladin_beaconsoflight.jpg) Beacon of Faith on two ranged targets who have weak survivability (Hunters, Shadow Priests, Boomkins, etc).
2.  Cast ![Image 173: Beacon of Virtue Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/ability_paladin_beaconofinsight.jpg) Beacon of Virtue as much as possible during a fight. Try to line it up with heavy damage windows without keeping it on cooldown for too long. If you are having mana issues, you can cast it less frequently.
3.  Use ![Image 174: Blessing of Summer Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/ability_ardenweald_paladin_summer.jpg) Blessing of Summer as much as possible during a fight. Every buff can be safely placed upon yourself with only ![Image 175: Blessing of Summer Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/ability_ardenweald_paladin_summer.jpg) Blessing of Summer requiring any additional thought (when possible, aim to have it up during cooldowns.)
4.  Keep ![Image 176: Holy Prism Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_paladin_holyprism.jpg) Holy Prism on cooldown as much as possible to proc ![Image 177: Dawnlight Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/inv_ability_heraldofthesunpaladin_dawnlight.jpg) Dawnlight. When possible, you will want to use Holy Prism during ![Image 178: Awakening Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/inv_helm_plate_raidpaladin_n_01.jpg) Awakening to generate extra ![Image 179: Sun's Avatar Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/ability_paladin_holyavenger.jpg) Sun's Avatar procs.
5.  Keep ![Image 180: Barrier of Faith Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/ability_paladin_barrieroffaith.jpg) Barrier of Faith on cooldown as much as possible to proc ![Image 181: Dawnlight Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/inv_ability_heraldofthesunpaladin_dawnlight.jpg) Dawnlight.

Holy Paladin — Avenging Crusader
--------------------------------

This build plays a bit unique in the fact that it takes ![Image 204: Avenging Crusader Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/ability_paladin_veneration.jpg) Avenging Crusader and specs into ![Image 205](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/tools/hero-talents/lightsmith.webp) Lightsmith instead of the common ![Image 206](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/tools/hero-talents/herald-of-the-sun.webp) Herald of the Sun. It places a high emphasis on ![Image 207: Judgment Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_holy_righteousfury.jpg) Judgment and ![Image 208: Crusader Strike Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_holy_crusaderstrike.jpg) Crusader Strike in order to output as much healing as possible.

1.  Keep ![Image 209: Beacon of Light Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/ability_paladin_beaconoflight.jpg) Beacon of Light and ![Image 210: Beacon of Faith Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/ability_paladin_beaconsoflight.jpg) Beacon of Faith on two ranged targets who have weak survivability (Hunters, Shadow Priests, Boomkins, etc).
2.  Cast ![Image 211: Beacon of Virtue Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/ability_paladin_beaconofinsight.jpg) Beacon of Virtue as much as possible during a fight. Try to line it up with heavy damage windows without keeping it on cooldown for too long. If you are having mana issues, you can cast it less frequently.
3.  Use ![Image 212: Blessing of Summer Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/ability_ardenweald_paladin_summer.jpg) Blessing of Summer as much as possible during a fight. Every buff can be safely placed upon yourself with only ![Image 213: Blessing of Summer Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/ability_ardenweald_paladin_summer.jpg) Blessing of Summer requiring any additional thought (when possible, aim to have it up during cooldowns.)
4.  Keep ![Image 214: Sacred Weapon Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/inv_ability_lightsmithpaladin_sacredweapon.jpg) Sacred Weapon on cooldown as much as possible.
5.  If at 5 Holy Power, make sure to spend.
6.  Cast ![Image 215: Judgment Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_holy_righteousfury.jpg) Judgment as much as possible.
7.  Cast ![Image 216: Holy Shock Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_holy_searinglight.jpg) Holy Shock as much as possible.
8.  Keep ![Image 217: Holy Prism Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_paladin_holyprism.jpg) Holy Prism on cooldown as much as possible.
9.  Keep ![Image 218: Barrier of Faith Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/ability_paladin_barrieroffaith.jpg) Barrier of Faith on cooldown as much as possible.
10.  Cast ![Image 219: Word of Glory Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/inv_helmet_96.jpg) Word of Glory when you have the ![Image 220: Empyrean Legacy Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/item_holyspark.jpg) Empyrean Legacy proc off cooldown.
11.  Cast ![Image 221: Crusader Strike Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_holy_crusaderstrike.jpg) Crusader Strike.
12.  Spend Remaining Holy Power on ![Image 222: Light of Dawn Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_paladin_lightofdawn.jpg) Light of Dawn or ![Image 223: Word of Glory Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/inv_helmet_96.jpg) Word of Glory.
13.  Cast ![Image 224: Hammer of Wrath Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_paladin_hammerofwrath.jpg) Hammer of Wrath.
14.  Keep ![Image 225: Tyr's Deliverance Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/inv_mace_2h_artifactsilverhand_d_01.jpg) Tyr's Deliverance on cooldown as much as possible.
15.  Cast ![Image 226: Hammer of Wrath Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_paladin_hammerofwrath.jpg) Hammer of Wrath when you cannot do any of the above.
16.  Cast ![Image 227: Consecration Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_holy_innerfire.jpg) Consecration when you cannot do any of the above.

It is important to note that your rotation slightly differs when inside and outside of ![Image 228: Avenging Crusader Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/ability_paladin_veneration.jpg) Avenging Crusader. When inside of this cooldown, your priority, above all else, will be to keep ![Image 229: Judgment Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_holy_righteousfury.jpg) Judgment and ![Image 230: Crusader Strike Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_holy_crusaderstrike.jpg) Crusader Strike on cooldown. You will also want to be triggering ![Image 231: Blessed Assurance Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_holy_blessedlife.jpg) Blessed Assurance between each Crusader Strike cast. Because of this, your in ![Image 232: Avenging Crusader Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/ability_paladin_veneration.jpg) Avenging Crusader rotation will look something like this:

1.  Cast ![Image 233: Judgment Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_holy_righteousfury.jpg) Judgment
2.  Spend Holy Power
3.  Cast ![Image 234: Crusader Strike Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_holy_crusaderstrike.jpg) Crusader Strike
4.  Cast ![Image 235: Judgment Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_holy_righteousfury.jpg) Judgment

When you do not have Holy Power to spend, you can instead cast ![Image 236: Holy Shock Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_holy_searinglight.jpg) Holy Shock to help you generate Holy Power between casts. The goal is to follow that rotation as closely as possible to maximize your ![Image 237: Avenging Crusader Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/ability_paladin_veneration.jpg) Avenging Crusader healing. When you are outside of this cooldown, you can follow the standard rotation detailed above.

6.

Holy Paladin — Mythic+
----------------------

Many of the priorities you would use in raiding content will stay the same in Mythic+. The main exception to this is the increased importance of ![Image 238: Consecration Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_holy_innerfire.jpg) Consecration, ![Image 239: Judgment Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_holy_righteousfury.jpg) Judgment, and ![Image 240: Shield of the Righteous Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/ability_paladin_shieldofvengeance.jpg) Shield of the Righteous in order to output extra damage because no healing is needed.

2.  Cast ![Image 243: Beacon of Virtue Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/ability_paladin_beaconofinsight.jpg) Beacon of Virtue as much as possible during a fight. Try to line it up with heavy damage windows without keeping it on cooldown for too long. If you are having mana issues, you can cast it less frequently.
3.  Use ![Image 244: Blessing of Summer Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/ability_ardenweald_paladin_summer.jpg) Blessing of Summer as much as possible during a fight. Every buff can be safely placed upon yourself with only ![Image 245: Blessing of Summer Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/ability_ardenweald_paladin_summer.jpg) Blessing of Summer requiring any additional thought (when possible, aim to have it up during cooldowns or large packs)
4.  Keep ![Image 246: Sacred Weapon Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/inv_ability_lightsmithpaladin_sacredweapon.jpg) Sacred Weapon on cooldown as much as possible.

8.  Keep ![Image 249: Holy Prism Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_paladin_holyprism.jpg) Holy Prism on cooldown as much as possible.
9.  Keep ![Image 250: Barrier of Faith Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/ability_paladin_barrieroffaith.jpg) Barrier of Faith on cooldown as much as possible.
10.  Cast ![Image 251: Word of Glory Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/inv_helmet_96.jpg) Word of Glory when you have the ![Image 252: Empyrean Legacy Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/item_holyspark.jpg) Empyrean Legacy proc off cooldown.
11.  Spend Holy Power on ![Image 253: Word of Glory Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/inv_helmet_96.jpg) Word of Glory when healing is needed, or ![Image 254: Shield of the Righteous Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/ability_paladin_shieldofvengeance.jpg) Shield of the Righteous when no healing is needed.
12.  Cast ![Image 255: Holy Shock Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_holy_searinglight.jpg) Holy Shock as much as possible.
13.  Aim to cast ![Image 256: Holy Light Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_holy_surgeoflight.jpg) Holy Light when you have both a ![Image 257: Divine Favor Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_holy_heal.jpg) Divine Favor proc available**AND** a ![Image 258: Infusion of Light Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/ability_paladin_infusionoflight.jpg) Infusion of Light proc.
14.  Cast ![Image 259: Crusader Strike Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_holy_crusaderstrike.jpg) Crusader Strike to reduce ![Image 260: Holy Shock Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_holy_searinglight.jpg) Holy Shock cooldown.
15.  Cast ![Image 261: Hammer of Wrath Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_paladin_hammerofwrath.jpg) Hammer of Wrath.
16.  Spend remaining Holy Power if possible.
17.  Cast ![Image 262: Hammer of Wrath Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_paladin_hammerofwrath.jpg) Hammer of Wrath when you cannot do any of the above.
18.  Consume ![Image 263: Infusion of Light Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/ability_paladin_infusionoflight.jpg) Infusion of Light when you have nothing else to do and a proc available.

20.  Cast ![Image 265: Consecration Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_holy_innerfire.jpg) Consecration when you cannot do any of the above.

Keep in mind that damage may occur in Mythic+ settings that you did not expect. If you are constantly spending Holy Power whenever possible, you may not have Holy Power available when healing is needed. For this reason, it can often be wise as a beginner player to only cast ![Image 266: Shield of the Righteous Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/ability_paladin_shieldofvengeance.jpg) Shield of the Righteous when you have 4-5 Holy Power; that way, you can quickly generate extra Holy Power when healing is needed unexpectedly.

6.1.

### Cooldown Usage for Holy Paladins

As a Holy Paladin, you have several healing cooldowns. You should use them as we explain below:

1.   ![Image 267: Avenging Wrath Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_holy_avenginewrath.jpg) Avenging Wrath increases your healing done and damage done by 20% for 20 seconds. It is very useful during periods of high sustained damage.
2.   ![Image 268: Divine Toll Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/ability_bastion_paladin.jpg) Divine Toll is a strong burst heal that can be used to quickly generate Holy Power, or simply get your party healthy.
3.   ![Image 269: Tyr's Deliverance Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/inv_mace_2h_artifactsilverhand_d_01.jpg) Tyr's Deliverance will buff your allies, increasing the healing you can do to them with ![Image 270: Flash of Light Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_holy_flashheal.jpg) Flash of Light, ![Image 271: Holy Light Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_holy_surgeoflight.jpg) Holy Light, and ![Image 272: Holy Shock Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_holy_searinglight.jpg) Holy Shock. When using this ability, you will want to make sure you are casting these spells on buffed allies, as well as extending the duration as long as possible with the ![Image 273: Boundless Salvation Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/ability_paladin_selflesshealer.jpg) Boundless Salvation.
4.   ![Image 274: Lay on Hands Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_holy_layonhands.jpg) Lay on Hands should be used to save dying raid members, especially tanks.
5.   ![Image 275: Blessing of Sacrifice Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_holy_sealofsacrifice.jpg) Blessing of Sacrifice lasts 12 seconds, transferring 30% of the damage taken by your target to you. The effect is automatically canceled if the transferred damage would cause you to fall below 20% health. This cooldown is excellent for reducing the damage taken by the tank or other raid members. Be cautious, however, because Blessing of Sacrifice can be dangerous to your own life if used without a damage reduction cooldown, such as ![Image 276: Divine Protection Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_holy_divineprotection.jpg) Divine Protection or ![Image 277: Divine Shield Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_holy_divineshield.jpg) Divine Shield, or when simultaneous raid damage independently threatens your life such that the additional damage taken from Blessing of Sacrifice can lead to your death.
6.   ![Image 278: Aura Mastery Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_holy_auramastery.jpg) Aura Mastery empowers your chosen aura, increasing its range to 40 yards and also improving its efficiency. It is a raid cooldown, and it should be used at a time designated by your healing officer or raid leader.
7.   ![Image 279: Blessing of Protection Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_holy_sealofprotection.jpg) Blessing of Protection can be used to clear harmful physical damage debuffs and bleeds from the target. Be mindful of the fact that bosses will not attack targets affected by Blessing of Protection, though, so only cast it on the current tank if the off-tank is prepared to take over.
8.   ![Image 280: Blessing of Freedom Icon](https://static.icy-veins.com/images/wow/large_icons/spell_holy_sealofvalor.jpg) Blessing of Freedom removes movement-impairing effects from the targeted raid member, which can be very useful in certain situations.
