# Core Visuals

The **Core Visuals** module in Sylvanas offers a variety of powerful visual aids to enhance your awareness during gameplay. It includes three main features: **ESP** , **Cursor Highlighter** , and **Highlighter**. These features are designed to help you track enemies, identify dangerous areas, and enhance your overall experience. By using the **Core Visuals** module, you can greatly improve your situational awareness in the game, whether it’s tracking enemy players through walls, keeping tabs on your cursor during heated moments, or avoiding dangerous zones in dungeons or PvP.

## 1 - ESP (Extrasensory Perception)[​](https://docs.project-sylvanas.net/docs/<#1---esp-extrasensory-perception> "Direct link to 1---esp-extrasensory-perception")

The **ESP** feature allows you to highlight units, even through walls, making it easier to track enemy players in real-time. By default, it is configured to highlight **enemy players** in red, which is especially useful in **Open World** or **Battlegrounds** to quickly identify threats.
You can access the ESP settings by following this path: **Main Menu - > Core Visuals -> ESP Settings**

In the **ESP Settings** , you will find **Filters** and **Drawings** options, which allow you to customize the ESP behavior. By default, it renders:

- **Red glow** on enemy players, even through walls.
- **Distance in yards** and **class names** of the enemies.

By default, the ESP ignores **NPCs** and **ally players** , but these settings can be customized to your preference. Additionally, you can disable the glow effect and configure ESP to only display names, health bars, or circles around enemies with customizable colors.

## 2 - Cursor Highlighter[​](https://docs.project-sylvanas.net/docs/<#2---cursor-highlighter> "Direct link to 2---cursor-highlighter")

The **Cursor Highlighter** feature helps keep track of your cursor during intense combat. It draws a small circle around your cursor, by default in **yellow** , making it easy to spot while fighting.
You can modify the cursor's:

- **Color**
- **Circle type**
- **Size** and more in the settings menu.

To access the **Cursor Highlighter** settings: **Main Menu - > Core Visuals -> Cursor Settings**

By default, this feature is only active during combat, but you can adjust it to your needs.

## 3 - Highlighter[​](https://docs.project-sylvanas.net/docs/<#3---highlighter> "Direct link to 3---highlighter")

The **Highlighter** feature is designed to show danger zones, helping you avoid harmful areas during both **dungeons** and **PvP**. It highlights dangerous areas with visual indicators, making it easier to dodge incoming threats.
This framework is still in development and requires more custom areas to be added, but it already supports some **dungeon** mechanics and **PvP** scenarios. For example, it will display a **red circle** around a **Hunter’s freezing trap** so you can avoid stepping into it.
