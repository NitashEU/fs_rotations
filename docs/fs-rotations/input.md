# Input Functions and Spell Queue

In this module we introduce one of the most (if not the most) important features for scripting: a way to manage input from code. For now, this only includes spell casting. However, stay tuned to the changelogs, since other input methods like movement are planned to be supported in the near future.

## The Way Raw Input Functions Work

Similar to what we previously discussed in the [buffs](https://docs.project-sylvanas.net/docs/<https:/docs.project-sylvanas.net/docs/buffs>) page, the raw input functions that the game provides to us have some disadvantages. In this case, they are not FPS-related, but rather usability and safety related. These functions basically send a paquet to the game's server that mimics a legit spell cast or movement. Therefore, spamming raw inputs from code may be dangerous since you might be sending many more requests per seconds than any human would be able to send. So far, this is not a problem for us, but it's something to take into account for the future, as Blizzard anticheat evolves. The real problem is usability üí•: 1 - Compatibility between plugins: If your scripts spam input requests, you will make everything else useless. For example, other modules like "Core Interrupt" might want to cast a spell to interrupt an important enemy cast. This usually has more priority than the normal damage rotation, but since you are flooding the server with your requests, the interruptor spell cast request won't have a chance to be sent. 2 - User Experience: If your script spam input requests you make the user unable to cast their own spells manually. As you could imagine, there might me certain situations in which the users have to cast certain spells on their own, so blocking this could be very frustrating them. To fix this, we handle everything in our LUA Spell Queue Module, which will be explained in detail below.
warning
You can still use raw input functions, but at your own risk. We advise you to read thoroughly the previous explanation and check if you really really need to use the raw functions. If you have any question, contact us and we will guide you through without any problem - Better safe than sorry. ‚ù§Ô∏è
note
For some items that don't have global cooldown, the raw "Use Item" functions are perfectly fine, just make sure to add checks before the cast so you don't spam when the item isn't ready.

## Raw Input Functions üìÉ[‚Äã](https://docs.project-sylvanas.net/docs/<#raw-input-functions-> "Direct link to Raw Input Functions üìÉ")

### Cast Target Spell üí£[‚Äã](https://docs.project-sylvanas.net/docs/<#cast-target-spell-> "Direct link to Cast Target Spell üí£")

`core.input.cast_target_spell(spell_id: integer, target: game_object) -> boolean`

- Cast a spell directly at a target.
- Parameters:
  - `spell_id`: The ID of your chosen spell
  - `target`: The [game_object](https://docs.project-sylvanas.net/docs/<https:/docs.project-sylvanas.net/docs/game-object>) that you want to cast the spell to
- Returns: `true` if the spell was cast, `false` if it fizzled

note
This function JUST sends a cast request to the server. It doesn't check if the enemy is close enough, if you are facing it, if the spell is ready, etc. Therefore, you must apply all these checks before casting. To do so, we created a LUA Spell Helper module that will make the job very easy. Check [spell book](https://docs.project-sylvanas.net/docs/<https:/docs.project-sylvanas.net/docs/spell-book>).
We advise you to check the Spell Book module before jumping into input code. This is the proper way you should be casting spells:

```
---@type spell_helperlocal spell_helper =require("common/utility/spell_helper")---@type plugin_helperlocal plugin_helper =require("common/utility/plugin_helper")local last_cast_time =0.0core.register_on_update_callback(function()-- if we remove this check, you will see in the console that more than 1 cast request is issued.-- To avoid this and only send one (this is good practice behaviour), we add a minimum delay of 0.25 seconds -- for this function to be ran again.local current_time = core.game_time()if current_time - last_cast_time <0.50thenreturnfalseendlocal local_player = core.object_manager.get_local_player()ifnot local_player thenreturnend-- since this is just a test, we will just get the hud targetlocal hud_target = local_player:get_target()-- only cast the fireball when there is a target selectedifnot hud_target thenreturnend-- avoid spamming cast request while already casting-- NOTE: in your scripts, you might want to do the same for channels.-- approach 1: take into account network latency-- local network = plugin_helper:get_latency()-- local cast_end_time = local_player:get_active_spell_cast_end_time()-- local cast_delta = math.max(cast_end_time - current_time, 0.0)-- if cast_delta > (network * 1000) then--   return-- end-- approach 2: more simple, works well in most cases.local cast_end_time = local_player:get_active_spell_cast_end_time()if current_time <= cast_end_time thenreturnendlocal fireball_id =133-- check first if the spell is castable, so we avoid sending useless packets (the script will be stuck permanently trying to cast a spell that can't be casted)local can_cast_fireball = spell_helper:is_spell_castable(fireball_id, local_player, hud_target,false,false)ifnot can_cast_fireball thenreturnendlocal spell_cast = core.input.cast_target_spell(fireball_id, hud_target)if spell_cast then    core.log("Fireball Cast!")    last_cast_time = current_timeendend)
```

This example might be an overkill, specially if you are a beginner and are learning. Feel free to play with the code and go step by step. However, if you want to produce good quality products, consider adding at least all the steps specified in the previous example to your casts.

### Cast Position Spell üí£[‚Äã](https://docs.project-sylvanas.net/docs/<#cast-position-spell-> "Direct link to Cast Position Spell üí£")

`core.input.cast_position_spell(spell_id: integer, position: vec3) -> boolean`

- Cast a spell at a specific location in the world.
- Parameters:
  - `spell_id`: Your spell's ID
  - `position`: The XYZ coordinates for your spell. See [vec3](https://docs.project-sylvanas.net/docs/<https:/docs.project-sylvanas.net/docs/vector-3>)
- Returns: `true` if cast successfully, `false` if not

note
This function is only used for spells that don't require a target game_object, but instead require a target [position](https://docs.project-sylvanas.net/docs/<https:/docs.project-sylvanas.net/docs/vector-3>). This is usually the case for some AOE spells like Blizzard or Flamestrike.
Let's cast a Flamestrike:

```
---@type spell_helperlocal spell_helper =require("common/utility/spell_helper")---@type plugin_helperlocal plugin_helper =require("common/utility/plugin_helper")local last_cast_time =0.0core.register_on_update_callback(function()-- if we remove this check, you will see in the console that more than 1 cast request is issued.-- To avoid this and only send one (this is good practice behaviour), we add a minimum delay of 0.25 seconds -- for this function to be ran again.local current_time = core.game_time()if current_time - last_cast_time <0.50thenreturnfalseendlocal local_player = core.object_manager.get_local_player()ifnot local_player thenreturnend-- since this is just a test, we will just get the hud targetlocal hud_target = local_player:get_target()-- only cast the fireball when there is a target selectedifnot hud_target thenreturnend-- avoid spamming cast request while already casting-- NOTE: in your scripts, you might want to do the same for channels.-- approach 1: take into account network latency-- local network = plugin_helper:get_latency()-- local cast_end_time = local_player:get_active_spell_cast_end_time()-- local cast_delta = math.max(cast_end_time - current_time, 0.0)-- if cast_delta > (network * 1000) then--   return-- end-- approach 2: more simple, works well in most cases.local cast_end_time = local_player:get_active_spell_cast_end_time()if current_time <= cast_end_time thenreturnendlocal flamestrike_id =2120-- check first if the spell is castable, so we avoid sending useless packets (the script will be stuck permanently trying to cast a spell that can't be casted)local can_cast_fireball = spell_helper:is_spell_castable(flamestrike_id, local_player, hud_target,false,false)ifnot can_cast_fireball thenreturnendlocal position_to_cast = hud_target:get_position()local spell_cast = core.input.cast_position_spell(flamestrike_id, position_to_cast)if spell_cast then    core.log("Flamestrike Cast On Target Position!")    last_cast_time = current_timeendend)
```

tip
As you can see, in the previous example we are casting the spell to the target's position, without any further checks. For AOE spells, you would ideally want to cast on the position that would hit the most enemies, which is usually not the same as your main target's position. To do this, you should use some sort of algorithm to determine which is the actual best point to cast, according to your spell's characteristics. To do this, we have developed the "Spell Prediction" module. See [Spell Prediction Module](https://docs.project-sylvanas.net/docs/<https:/docs.project-sylvanas.net/docs/spell-prediction>)

### Use Item üé≠[‚Äã](https://docs.project-sylvanas.net/docs/<#use-item-> "Direct link to Use Item üé≠")

We have three item usage functions, each with its own purpose:
1- Item Self-Cast `core.input.use_item(item_id: integer) -> boolean`

- This function is used for items that don't require a target or a target position.

2- Item Targeted-Cast `core.input.use_item_target(item_id: integer, target: game_object) -> boolean`

- This function is used for items that require a target or a target position.

3- Item Position-Cast `core.input.use_item_position(item_id: integer, position: vec3) -> boolean`

- Use an item at a specific location. (Note: This feature is still in development)

tip
Most items don't have a global cooldown, so these raw functions are usually fine, as we discussed earlier. However, for items that apply GCD, consider using the spell_queue.
The code for casting items is pretty similar to the code for casting spells. You just have to be careful with the way you check if the item is ready, since it's different from checking if a spell is ready. Below, a simple example on how to cast a health potion:

```
---@type unit_helperlocal unit_helper =require("common/utility/unit_helper")local last_cast_time =0.0core.register_on_update_callback(function()-- if we remove this check, you will see in the console that more than 1 cast request is issued.-- To avoid this and only send one (this is good practice behaviour), we add a minimum delay of 0.25 seconds -- for this function to be ran again.local current_time = core.game_time()if current_time - last_cast_time <5.0thenreturnfalseendlocal local_player = core.object_manager.get_local_player()ifnot local_player thenreturnendlocal cast_end_time = local_player:get_active_spell_cast_end_time()if current_time <= cast_end_time thenreturnend-- the potion for this example is the "Greater Healing Potion"local potion_id =1710local item_cooldown = local_player:get_item_cooldown(potion_id)local can_cast_potion = item_cooldown <=0.0ifnot can_cast_potion thenreturnfalseend-- we add this check so the potion is not attempted to be cast while full HP, since the game won't allow it.if unit_helper:get_health_percentage(local_player)>=1.0thenreturnfalseendlocal spell_cast = core.input.use_item(potion_id)if spell_cast then    core.log("Potion cast!")    last_cast_time = current_timeendend)
```

### Set Target üéØ[‚Äã](https://docs.project-sylvanas.net/docs/<#set-target-> "Direct link to Set Target üéØ")

`core.input.set_target(unit: game_object) -> boolean`

- Set your current target.
- Returns: `true` if targeting was successful, `false` if not

Example:

```
local local_player = core.object_manager.get_local_player()if local_player thenlocal player_position = local_player:get_position()local nearby_enemies = unit_helper:get_enemy_list_around(player_position,30)for _, unit inipairs(nearby_enemies)dolocal success = core.input.set_target(unit)if success then      core.log("New target acquired! üéØ")breakelse      core.log("Targeting failed. They're quick! üí®")endendend
```

### Set and Get Focus üîç[‚Äã](https://docs.project-sylvanas.net/docs/<#set-and-get-focus-> "Direct link to Set and Get Focus üîç")

- `core.input.set_focus(unit: game_object) -> boolean`: Set your focus target
- `core.input.get_focus() -> game_object | nil`: Retrieve your current focus

Checking your focus:

```
local current_focus = core.input.get_focus()if current_focus then  core.log("Current focus: ".. current_focus:get_name().." üîç")else  core.log("No focus set currently")end
```

## Spell Queue Module: Advanced Spell Management üß†[‚Äã](https://docs.project-sylvanas.net/docs/<#spell-queue-module-advanced-spell-management-> "Direct link to Spell Queue Module: Advanced Spell Management üß†")

As discussed earlier, spell_queue module offers sophisticated spell management with priority queuing. It's the go-to tool for complex spell rotations and efficient casting, and what you should be using in most cases.

## The Way The Spell Queue Module Works

Basically, this module just implements a for spell casts. When you send a spell cast request, it's added into the queue with a priority value that's passed by parameter. The queue is sorted every frame according to the priority values of the elements inside the said data structure. This way, we can make sure that the most important spells are casted before the less important ones, and we also secure compatibility between plugins, as any plugin can send a cast request at any given time.

### Importing the Module[‚Äã](https://docs.project-sylvanas.net/docs/<#importing-the-module> "Direct link to Importing the Module")

```
---@type spell_queuelocal spell_queue =require("common/modules/spell_queue")
```

warning
Remember to use the colon (:) when calling spell_queue methods!

### Queue Spell with Target üéØ[‚Äã](https://docs.project-sylvanas.net/docs/<#queue-spell-with-target-> "Direct link to Queue Spell with Target üéØ")

`spell_queue:queue_spell_target(spell_id: number, target: game_object, priority: number, message?: string)`

- Queue a targeted spell with priority.
- `priority`: Higher numbers = higher priority (1 is default, 9 is highest)
- `message`: Optional logging message

Queueing a Fireball:

```
---@type spell_helperlocal spell_helper =require("common/utility/spell_helper")---@type plugin_helperlocal plugin_helper =require("common/utility/plugin_helper")---@type spell_queuelocal spell_queue =require("common/modules/spell_queue")local last_cast_time =0.0core.register_on_update_callback(function()-- if we remove this check, you will see in the console that more than 1 cast request is issued.-- To avoid this and only send one (this is good practice behaviour), we add a minimum delay of 0.25 seconds -- for this function to be ran again.local current_time = core.game_time()if current_time - last_cast_time <0.50thenreturnfalseendlocal local_player = core.object_manager.get_local_player()ifnot local_player thenreturnend-- since this is just a test, we will just get the hud targetlocal hud_target = local_player:get_target()-- only cast the fireball when there is a target selectedifnot hud_target thenreturnend-- avoid spamming cast request while already casting-- NOTE: in your scripts, you might want to do the same for channels.-- approach 1: take into account network latency-- local network = plugin_helper:get_latency()-- local cast_end_time = local_player:get_active_spell_cast_end_time()-- local cast_delta = math.max(cast_end_time - current_time, 0.0)-- if cast_delta > (network * 1000) then--   return-- end-- approach 2: more simple, works well in most cases.local cast_end_time = local_player:get_active_spell_cast_end_time()if current_time <= cast_end_time thenreturnendlocal fireball_id =133-- check first if the spell is castable, so we avoid sending useless packets (the script will be stuck permanently trying to cast a spell that can't be casted)local can_cast_fireball = spell_helper:is_spell_castable(fireball_id, local_player, hud_target,false,false)ifnot can_cast_fireball thenreturnend  spell_queue:queue_spell_target(fireball_id, hud_target,1,"Trying to cast fireball!")  last_cast_time = current_timeend)
```

As you can see, the code is pretty much the same as the code that we would use for raw functions, the only thing that changes is the way we are attempting to cast the spell.

### Queue Fast Spell with Target üéØ[‚Äã](https://docs.project-sylvanas.net/docs/<#queue-fast-spell-with-target-> "Direct link to Queue Fast Spell with Target üéØ")

`spell_queue:queue_spell_target_fast(spell_id: number, target: game_object, priority: number, message?: string)` The code would be exactly the same as the previous example, you just need to replace the queue spell function call.

### Queue Spell with Position üéØ[‚Äã](https://docs.project-sylvanas.net/docs/<#queue-spell-with-position-> "Direct link to Queue Spell with Position üéØ")

`spell_queue:queue_spell_position(spell_id: number, position: vec3, priority: number, message?: string)`

- Queue a position-based spell.

As you can imagine, the code to cast Flamestrike using spell queue is pretty much the same as the code we used to cast Flamestrike with raw spells, the only thing that changes is the way we are issuing the actual cast. So, maybe it's more interesting to use the [spell prediction](https://docs.project-sylvanas.net/docs/<https:/docs.project-sylvanas.net/docs/spell-prediction>) for a smart Blizzard cast for this example:

```
local local_player = core.object_manager.get_local_player()if local_player thenlocal hud_target = local_player:get_target()if hud_target thenlocal blizzard_id =10local player_position = local_player:get_position()local prediction_spell_data = spell_prediction:new_spell_data(      blizzard_id,-- spell_id30,-- range            6,-- radius0.2,-- cast_time0.0,-- projectile_speed      spell_prediction.prediction_type.MOST_HITS,-- prediction_type      spell_prediction.geometry_type.CIRCLE,-- geometry_type      player_position                 -- source_position)local prediction_result = spell_prediction:get_cast_position(hud_target, prediction_spell_data)if prediction_result and prediction_result.amount_of_hits >0then      spell_queue:queue_spell_position(blizzard_id, prediction_result.cast_position,1,"Queueing Blizzard at optimal position")endendend
```

This code:

1. Sets up a Blizzard spell with prediction data
2. Uses `MOST_HITS` prediction type to maximize the spell's impact
3. Queues the Blizzard at the optimal position if targets are predicted to be hit

![](https://downloads.project-sylvanas.net/1726863254744-docs_input_prediction_most_hits.png)
note
As you can see, we call `prediction_type.MOST_HITS` to fire Death and Decay on the Priest. Instead of casting on the center, it strategically places the spell slightly to the left to hit extra dummies aswell.
tip
Test with the `prediction_type.ACCURACY` values for pinpointing situations where the cast should be avoided

### Queue Fast Spell with Position üéØ[‚Äã](https://docs.project-sylvanas.net/docs/<#queue-fast-spell-with-position-> "Direct link to Queue Fast Spell with Position üéØ")

`spell_queue:queue_spell_position_fast(spell_id: number, position: vec3, priority: number, message?: string)`

- Queue a position-based spell that ignores the global cooldown.

The code would be exactly the same as the previous example, you just need to replace the queue spell function call

## Best Practices üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüí°[‚Äã](https://docs.project-sylvanas.net/docs/<#best-practices-Ô∏è> "Direct link to Best Practices üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüí°")

1- Embrace the Spell Queue 2- Remember the priority scale (1-9). Use it to create sophisticated casting logic.
warning
Be cautious with priority levels! While `1` is the default, higher priorities should be applied only when absolutely necessary.
`1` is the default priority, intended for the majority of spells in the standard rotation. Developers should strive to keep spells at priority `1` unless a clear, specific reason justifies using a higher priority. This preserves rotation efficiency and prevents disruption.
Higher priorities are intended for spells that require urgent action outside the rotation. **For example, interrupts use priority`7`** to ensure they execute immediately when conditions demand it, as timing is crucial for effective interruption. Core utility spells, such as racials, dispels, or spell reflections, are typically set between **`4`to`6`**. They preempt the rotation without overshadowing interrupts, allowing critical utilities to occur in time-sensitive situations.
Finally, **priority`9`** is exclusively reserved for **manual player actions** , ensuring that the player‚Äôs chosen spell overrides any automated rotation or interrupt, with no delay.
In short, unless there is a compelling plan, **stick with priority`1`** for your spells. Use `2` only if you have a strong plan.
3- Fast Track Important Spells Use `_fast` versions for critical, non-GCD spells.
4- Leave Breadcrumbs Use the `message` parameter in spell_queue for easier debugging.
5- Learn to Use The Prediction Module The `spell_prediction` module is powerful and easy to use library to evolve your logics.
Remember, mastering these tools takes practice. Experiment with different combinations and priorities to find what works best for your scripting needs.
