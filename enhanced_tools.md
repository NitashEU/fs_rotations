# Enhanced Tools for Large Codebases

## Core Capabilities
1. **Code Semantic Analysis** - Understanding dependencies and relationships between components
2. **Intelligent Type Inference** - Automatically detecting and enforcing type constraints
3. **Automated Refactoring** - Safe, large-scale code transformations
4. **Contextual Auto-Complete** - Suggesting code completions based on surrounding context
5. **Architecture Visualization** - Generating visual representations of system structure
6. **Call Graph Analysis** - Mapping function calls across the codebase
7. **Code Metrics** - Analyzing complexity, coupling, and maintainability
8. **Dependency Management** - Analyzing and managing library dependencies
9. **Performance Profiling** - Identifying bottlenecks in code execution
10. **Code Search with Semantic Understanding** - Finding relevant code by meaning, not just keywords

## CLI Integration Tools
11. **Language Server Protocol Access** - Direct access to language-specific analysis tools
12. **Real-time Code Analysis** - Checking code validity as it's being written
13. **Test Impact Analysis** - Determining which tests need to run based on code changes
14. **Multi-workspace Understanding** - Working across multiple projects simultaneously
15. **Interactive Code Preview** - Showing results of changes before committing
16. **Change Conflict Detection** - Identifying potential merge conflicts early
17. **Code Generation Feedback** - Getting immediate validation of generated code
18. **Documentation Linking** - Connecting code to relevant documentation
19. **Workspace-aware Refactoring** - Applying consistent changes across entire workspaces
20. **Execution Environment Access** - Testing code in the actual runtime environment

## Extension API and Language Server Capabilities
21. **Symbol Provider Access** - Understanding all symbols (functions, classes, variables) in a workspace
22. **Diagnostics Integration** - Access to compiler/linter warnings and errors in real-time
23. **Code Definition Navigation** - Following references and implementations across the codebase
24. **Type Hierarchy Access** - Understanding inheritance and interface implementation relationships
25. **Semantic Token Information** - Detailed understanding of code syntax highlighting and semantics
26. **Programmatic Refactoring Access** - Performing complex refactorings through language servers
27. **Cross-file Symbol Resolution** - Resolving imports and references across module boundaries
28. **Document Link Provider** - Understanding URI references within code and documentation
29. **Language-specific Formatting Rules** - Applying language idioms and formatting conventions
30. **Workspace Symbol Search** - Finding symbols across the entire workspace by name pattern
